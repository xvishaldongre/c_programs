## Hello World Program

Below is a simple program printing Hello World in C language.

printf() is a system defined function under the header file stdio.h, used to print data onto the screen

\n is used to move the control onto the next line

\t is used to give a horizontal tab i.e. continuous five spaces

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("\n\n\t\tC Programs\n\n\n");
    int num;
    printf("\nHello world!\nWelcome to C Programs: Best place to learn\n");
    printf("\n\n\t\t\tCoding is Fun !\n\n\n");
    return 0;
}
```
